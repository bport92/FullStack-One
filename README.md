# FullStack-One
FullStack Development 

The frontend development toolkit comprises Express, HTML, JavaScript, and potentially SPAs to elevate user interactions. MongoDB was selected for the backend owing to its adaptability, scalability, and compatibility with JavaScript technologies, rendering it apt for a full-stack endeavor where data models may evolve, and responsiveness is paramount.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used for transmitting structured data between a server and a client. It is inspired by JavaScript object syntax but is distinct from the JavaScript programming language itself. JSON serves as a universal language for data exchange, providing a standardized format that is both human-readable and easy for machines to parse.
JSON ties together frontend and backend development pieces by providing a common format for exchanging data between them. Frontend applications can send JSON-formatted requests to backend APIs, which then process the data and respond with JSON-formatted results. This seamless interoperability enables frontend and backend components to communicate effectively, facilitating the development of full-stack applications.

Testing the API in a full-stack application entails evaluating the accuracy and security of methods (HTTP verbs), endpoints (URLs), and protective measures like authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation, rate limiting, and CORS policies. Thorough testing guarantees the API operates correctly, safeguards sensitive information, and shields against potential security risks.

This course has shown me that fullstack engineering is not easy. I learned a lot but most of what I have learned is that this stuff is difficult. When changing one thing, I found myself changing everything else along the way. Learning how to troubleshoot was the most common thing that I have done. I was not expecting to deal with the coding issues that we dealt with and think that I am better for the issues that we had.
